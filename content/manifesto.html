<h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct">(Modeled after the Ubuntu Code of Conduct)</a>

<br/>
<p>
When you join the Oran Developer Meetup, you will be in touch with hundred people,  and like any other growing community,
a few ground rules about expected behavior is good for everyone. This guideline covers both online (mailing lists, Github, Gitter, etc.)
and offline behavior (during in-person meetups and events).
</p>
<p>
    <b>Be nice, respectful and constructive:</b>  We're all part of the same community, so be friendly, be welcoming, and generally be a nice
    person. Be someone that other people want to be around. Also, we're a diverse group, so we're not going to agree all the time.
    Remember to be respectful and constructive with your communication to your fellow members. Don't get into flamewars, don't make
    personal attacks, don't vent or rant unconstructively. Everyone should take responsibility for the community and take the
    initiative to diffuse tension and stop a potential flamewar or negative thread as early as possible.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Participate and be collaborative:</b> This is YOUR community, so be a part of it! Join in on discussions, show up for in-person
    meetings regularly, offer feedback, and offer to help implement that feedback, share knowledge and share your  expertise! Together,
    we can learn a lot from each other.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Ask for help when unsure:</b> Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later,
    so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the Meetup organizers. Those who are asked should be responsive and
    helpful.
